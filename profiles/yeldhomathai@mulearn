### About Me

I am a 4th-year Computer Science and Engineering student at Sree Narayana Gurukulam College of Engineering, with a strong foundation in software development, web technologies, and programming languages such as C, Java, C++, Python, HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript.

My learning journey has been shaped through practical experiences, including a mini project on Phishing Website Detection, where I integrated machine learning models like Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM to classify URLs as phishing or safe. I’ve also built micro projects like a To-Do App and Tic-Tac-Toe game, which enhanced my understanding of full-stack development and UI logic.

I completed an internship in AI and Machine Learning at NeST Cyber Campus, which deepened my exposure to model training, real-world data processing, and intelligent system design. Alongside software development, I have a growing interest in data analytics—especially how data patterns can drive smarter decisions—and a passion for cybersecurity, with a focus on online threats, phishing awareness, and digital safety.

Driven by curiosity, adaptability, and a strong problem-solving mindset, I’m eager to take on new challenges and contribute meaningfully to impactful tech projects.
