### About Me

I am a passionate and driven Computer Science and Engineering student at SREE CHITRA THIRUNAL COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING with a strong foundation in software development, web technologies, and programming languages such as Java, Python, HTML, and JavaScript. My journey in tech has been enriched through hands-on projects like "VEEZHUMO"

I enjoy building creative and functional applications, especially use GitHub for version control and deployment. I’ve also explored cybersecurity concepts like online privacy and database security, reflecting my curiosity across domains. My adaptability, attention to detail, and eagerness to learn make me well-suited for collaborative projects and fast-paced environments.

Whether it’s debugging code, designing intuitive UI, or learning about AI-powered tools for presentations and automation, I approach each task with enthusiasm and a growth mindset. I’m currently seeking opportunities to further sharpen my skills and contribute meaningfully to projects that make a difference.
