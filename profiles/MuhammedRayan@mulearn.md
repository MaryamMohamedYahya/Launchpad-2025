### About Me

I am a passionate and curious Computer Science and Engineering student at the College of Engineering Kidangoor, specializing in full-stack development and AI-powered applications. My expertise spans the MERN stack, modern frameworks like Vite and Next.js, and AI integration tools such as LangChain, LangGraph, and NLP-based systems.

I enjoy building innovative and functional web applications with beautiful, intuitive UI, blending my coding skills with a strong sense of design. My projects — ranging from event platforms like *InterLink* to AI-driven tools — reflect my focus on solving real-world problems with technical creativity.

I have also explored emerging technologies like Blockchain, Web3, Agentic AI, Brain-Computer Interfaces, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) through academic seminars and personal research. My adaptability, problem-solving mindset, and eagerness to learn make me well-suited for collaborative, fast-paced tech environments.

Whether it's deploying a scalable web app, experimenting with AI agents, or fine-tuning a model for computer vision, I approach each challenge with curiosity and precision. I am currently working on advanced AI-based tools and looking forward to contributing to impactful projects.
